        <p><strong>Name: </strong>Sanchit Sharma</p>
        <p><strong>Student Number: </strong>S3949232</p>
        <p><strong>Email: </strong><a href="mailto:S3949232@student.rmit.edu.au">S3949232@student.rmit.edu.au</a></p>
        <p><strong>DOB: </strong>4/7/2003</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sanchit, I am a student at RMIT pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born
            in New Delhi, India and moved to Australia in 2008 when I was 5 years old as my parents wanted to
            seek a better life abroad. I started Prep in Australia while living in Clayton, and moved to Cranbourne when
            I was
            in year 3 (2012), where I still live. I can speak Hindi and English fluently, although I can’t read or write
            Hindi. I am an only child and most of my extended family lives in India, so growing up I have found my
            parents' friends and kids to be real family.
            <br><br>
            <strong>INTERESTING FACT Why am I interested in IT?</strong><br><br>
            I love anything and everything to do with technology! My passion for IT started when I was in year 3 and met
            a teacher who I believe started my passion for IT. He suggested I create a podcast for my school and with
            his support I hosted and edited weekly podcasts for a few years. He also taught me the basics of video
            editing and blogging during my years at primary school. In early secondary school, I used to mess with batch
            files and VBScript, using infamous programs such as the classic auto disk drive opener which got me into
            trouble. Around year 9 I started learning Javascript to build a basic website for my dad's company and over
            the years that ended up evolving into a large scale deployment in his company that managed many operations
            via input sensors in the production line, raspberry pi transmitters, web input forms and web dashboards.
            After a few years of maintaining these programs with javascript inefficiently communicating with my PHP
            backend I realised that while I learnt a lot and created a lot, a huge drawback of my self taught skills was
            that none of my code had comments, it was extremely insecure (I didn't even protect against SQL injection!)
            and the SQL database did not follow any structure. So instead of learning PHP security properly, I went
            all-in with Javascript and replaced my PHP backend with a fully translated NodeJS + ExpressJS server, this
            allowed for me to start from scratch, and as I was confident with JS it allowed me to focus on other aspects
            such as the security of the applications.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Why did I choose to study at RMIT?</strong><br><br>
            I chose to study at RMIT for a multitude of reasons, some valid others not so much. I knew quite a few
            people who pursued IT related degrees at RMIT and other universities and in all of the cases, I was highly
            recommended to go to RMIT. RMIT’s city campus also provides a great place to socialise and hang out in a
            central location which is better than other universities which have campuses in obscure suburbs.
            Additionally, a significant portion of my friend group also decided to pick RMIT uni as their main
            preference and thus that persuaded me even more to choose RMIT. The reason that ultimately chose RMIT was
            that it has “IT” in its name (yes seriously this was the catalyst).

            <br><br>
            <strong>What I expect to learn during my studies at RMIT:</strong><br><br>

            During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn a variety of skills that will help me later in life. I expect
            to learn key skills required for me to pursue a career in Information Technology and additionally due to
            being allowed to pick electives, learn extra knowledge on topics such as Cyber Security and CISCO Systems.

            <br><br>
            <strong>My business projects:</strong><br><br>
            I have created many enterprise data solutions for my dads company under the name "Continuity Data
            Solutions", unfortunatally I had to put that development on
            hiatus due to VCE Exams and things haven't calmed down enough for me to start work on it again.

        <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
        <p>My ideal job is a Senior Systems Administrator who specialises in Linux operating systems. A job
            that I found that suits this is <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56297664" target="_blank">“Senior Linux
                Systems Administrator” for Macquarie Group Limited.</a>
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56297664" target="_blank"><img src="img/seeklisting.png" height="400px"
                alt="">
            <img src="img/seeklisting2.png" height="400px" alt=""></a>
        <p>
            This job is particularly appealing to me as I love managing servers and server hardware, I even have my own
            server and NAS at home which I always tinker with. I also enjoy using Linux and learning my way through its
            terminal, which this job calls for as it requires Linux experience. I will also get to help consumers with
            issues and deliver business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The position of Senior Linux Systems Administrator entails a multitude of responsibilities, I will have to
            manage enterprise Linux distributions (such as RedHat Linux) and servers, and continuously troubleshoot and
            fix issues that arise with them. I will have to deal with any escalated issues which lower levels or IT
            support can not deal with, talk with shareholders about key IT decisions for the business, and additionally
            design future software and hardware configurations that the business may need.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the job position of Senior Linux Systems Administrator falls under the larger umbrella of IT jobs, it
            will require me to constantly learn and refine my skills as year after year, the standards within the
            industry drastically change and deployments quickly become outdated and incompatible if not maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IT industry focuses heavily on experience over qualifications and thus any undergraduate degree within
            the IT umbrella is acceptable (Information Technology, Computer Science, Software Development). A large
            amount of experience is required to obtain this job position, a candidate needs in-depth knowledge of Linux
            systems and must know how to deploy, maintain and troubleshoot them. A candidate must also have Level 3 IT
            Help Desk experience within a large company and should be able to automate as many processes as possible
            using tools such as “Puppet” and “Ansible”.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology and hope to learn key skills for future
            jobs, I have moderate experience with Linux Systems as my servers run Linux and I have limited experience
            with the automation service "Ansible". I believe that I have great problem-solving skills and determination
            that will entice any possible employer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan to obtain all the skills and qualifications required in a multitude of methods. Firstly I plan to
            finish my studies at RMIT to obtain a Bachelor of Information Technology and then I plan to do micro-courses
            online to gain industry-specific knowledge. I plan to start my IT career as an IT Helpdesk Intern, progress
            to an IT Helpdesk Technician, Junior Systems Administrator, Systems administrator and ultimately a Senior
            Systems Administrator. While this may seem straightforward, it is not and may take 15+ years to reach.

    <div class="card projectidea" id="projectidea">
        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <p>Overview (100 words):
            I plan to create a website and phone application which together allow an individual to print out QR Codes or
            write NFC tags that can facilitate a scavenger hunt. The objectives will be called “beacons” and the game
            “host” can create a certain amount of them which the program will then convert into either QR Codes or allow
            the host to write onto NFC tags. These “beacons” can then be placed in random locations in a certain area
            (can be as small as a room or even cover entire countries!) and the players will have to scan the QR Code or
            NFC tag using the corresponding mobile application, which keeps track of remaining beacons in the game and
            can give out hints to the player. The host can set up the game in multiple modes such as assigning players
            to teams or only allowing the beacons to be acquired in a certain order. The host will be able to see all
            the progress on their device and will be notified of the winner.
            <br>
            <br>

            Motivation (100 Words):
            As a child, I remember playing scavenger hunt with stamps tied to trees and a sheet where we had to collect
            them. These were fun but were only possible because we were in a closed environment (school) and there
            weren't a large number of groups playing at any given time. I want to expand that concept and allow anyone
            with a smartphone to easily set up a game and play with as many people as they want over as large of an area
            they desire. Current scavenger hunts take a long time to set up and require a high amount of administrative
            work to track winners and locations of objectives, I want to remove all that admin work and let a computer
            deal with it.
            <br>
            <br>
            How does it work?
            The service will feature an admin page for the host and a hunting page for the players.
            The main playstyle is based on the classic scavenger hunt and the objectives are called “beacons”.
            <br>
            <br>
            Hosting:
            On the website, the host will create a game that will have a unique code and will select the number of
            beacons they want. Here they will be able to individually name each beacon, enter its geographic location
            (optional), add a clue on how to find the beacon (optional) and enter a message they want to be displayed
            when a player captures the beacon (optional). After adding all beacons, the host can set the game mode and
            can then pick if the game will be played with QR Codes or via NFC. If the host selects QR Code, a pdf will
            be generated containing a QR Code for each location which whey can place there. If NFC is selected, the host
            will be prompted to switch to the phone app on an NFC capable phone, where they will be prompted to present
            an NFC card to write to for each beacon.
            <br>
            <br>
            Game Modes:
            The game can be played as a private group or open to the public, when private group beacons are scanned,
            they will require the user to be authenticated before the app accepts them.
            The host can pick if the beacons can be captured in any order or a specific order
            If the host supplied a geographical location for a beacon when creating the lobby they can enable location
            verification, where the player's device location will have to be within a certain radius of the beacon
            location when it is scanned to deter cheating.
            Individual: First player to capture all beacons will win
            Team: First team to capture all beacons will win
            Rush: Once a player/team captures a beacon no one else can scan it, once all beacons are captured the
            player/team with the majority of beacons will win
            <br>
            <br>
            Playing:
            The player will need to log in on either the mobile app or mobile-friendly website. When they scan a QR Code
            or NFC tag it will be read by the app/website and if the user is logged in and has access to the particular
            games lobby, it will be added to their inventory. They will be able to see a list of all the beacons in the
            game and view hints on how to access them, if it is a team game relevant statistics will also be displayed.
            If the host has enabled location verification the app/website will request the user's location to verify
            that they are physically near the beacon location.
            <br>
            <br>
            Security:
            If this project is released to the public, there may be personal data that has to be handled appropriately
            and additionally security risks with the use of QR Codes and NFC Tags. The service may collect the player's
            location if the host requires it and that information should only be stored for verification and not stored
            on the server as that would add unnecessary security risks to the service. The use of QR Codes and NFC Tags
            also has inherent security risks, as a user may scan a malicious QR Code or tap a malicious NFC Tag designed
            to look like a beacon code/tag. Currently, there are no known exploits that allow code execution on devices
            that scan QR Codes or NFC Tags, but there have been in the past and thus can exist in the future, this risk
            will always exist and there is no easy solution other than temporally disabling the service if an exploit
            like such is revealed.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tools and Technologies (100) words:
            For the development and deployment of the service, some key tools and technologies will be required. A
            server will be required that can run the backend programs, host databases and relay real-time lobby
            information between players and hosts.
            <br>
            <br>
            The key technologies that will be used are:
            HTML/CSS
            Javascript
            NodeJS
            Apache Cordova
            Progressive Web Apps
            QR Codes
            NFC Tags
            NFC Readers/Writers
            Android/IOS Apps
            SQL Databases
            <br>
            <br>
            Skills Required (100) words:
            A variety of skills are required to make this project functional, there needs to be proficiency in the
            programming languages that will likely be used, such as Javascript and PHP. Additionally, knowledge in SQL
            Databases is required as significant amounts of relational data may need to be processed. Some UI/UX
            designing experience is also ideal as a large number of visual interfaces need to be constructed.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outcome (100) Words:
            If this project is successful it will easily allow primary/secondary schools and event organisers to set up
            a scavenger hunt game. It will save them large amounts of time as they need to do very little physical work
            to set it up and for public games, the general public will get to enjoy mysterious QR Codes (although if you
            scan a random QR Code that's concerning) that lead them around places. If governments set up a game that
            covers a city it can cause great engagement within the city, especially with tourists.
