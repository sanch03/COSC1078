        <br><br>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sanchit, I am a student at RMIT pursuing a Bachelor of Information
            Technology. I was born
            in New Delhi, India and moved to Australia in 2008 when I was 5 years old as my parents
            wanted to
            seek a better life abroad. I started Prep in Australia while living in Clayton, and moved to
            Cranbourne when
            I was
            in year 3 (2012), where I still live. I can speak Hindi and English fluently, although I
            can’t read or write
            Hindi. I am an only child and most of my extended family lives in India, so growing up I
            have found my
            parents' friends and kids to be real family. <br>
            An interesting fact about me is that I am able to wiggle my ears, and as rare as that seems about 10-20% of
            the population can do it! (Nast, 2022)
        </p>
        <h2>Why am I interested in IT?</h2>
        <p>
            I love anything and everything to do with technology! My passion for IT started when I was
            in year 3 and met
            a teacher who I believe started my passion for IT. He suggested I create a podcast for my
            school and with
            his support I hosted and edited weekly podcasts for a few years. He also taught me the
            basics of video
            editing and blogging during my years at primary school. In early secondary school, I used to
            mess with batch
            files and VBScript, using infamous programs such as the classic auto disk drive opener which
            got me into
            trouble. Around year 9 I started learning Javascript to build a basic website for my dad's
            company and over
            the years that ended up evolving into a large scale deployment in his company that managed
            many operations
            via input sensors in the production line, raspberry pi transmitters, web input forms and web
            dashboards.
            After a few years of maintaining these programs with javascript inefficiently communicating
            with my PHP
            backend I realised that while I learnt a lot and created a lot, a huge drawback of my self
            taught skills was
            that none of my code had comments, it was extremely insecure (I didn't even protect against
            SQL injection!)
            and the SQL database did not follow any structure. So instead of learning PHP security
            properly, I went
            all-in with Javascript and replaced my PHP backend with a fully translated NodeJS +
            ExpressJS server, this
            allowed for me to start from scratch, and as I was confident with JS it allowed me to focus
            on other aspects
            such as the security of the applications.
        </p>
        <h2>Why did I choose to study at RMIT?</h2>
        <p>
            I chose to study at RMIT for a multitude of reasons, some valid others not so much. I knew
            quite a few
            people who pursued IT related degrees at RMIT and other universities and in all of the
            cases, I was highly
            recommended to go to RMIT. RMIT’s city campus also provides a great place to socialise and
            hang out in a
            central location which is better than other universities which have campuses in obscure
            suburbs.
            Additionally, a significant portion of my friend group also decided to pick RMIT uni as
            their main
            preference and thus that persuaded me even more to choose RMIT. The reason that ultimately
            chose RMIT was
            that it has “IT” in its name (yes seriously this was the catalyst).
        </p>

        <h2>What I expect to learn during my studies at RMIT:</h2>
        <p>

            During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn a variety of skills that will help me later in
            life. I expect
            to learn key skills required for me to pursue a career in Information Technology and
            additionally due to
            being allowed to pick electives, learn extra knowledge on topics such as Cyber Security and
            CISCO Systems.
        </p>


        <h2>My business projects:</h2>
        <p>
            I have created many enterprise data solutions for my dads company under the name "Continuity
            Data
            Solutions", unfortunatally I had to put that development on
            hiatus due to VCE Exams and things haven't calmed down enough for me to start work on it
            again.

    <div class="card idealjob" id="idealjob">
        <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
        <p>My ideal job is a Senior Systems Administrator who specialises in Linux operating systems. A job
            that I found that suits this is <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56297664" target="_blank">“Senior Linux
                Systems Administrator” for Macquarie Group Limited.</a>
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56297664" target="_blank"><img src="img/seeklisting.png" height="400px"
                alt="">
            <img src="img/seeklisting2.png" height="400px" alt=""></a>
        <p>
            This job is particularly appealing to me as I love managing servers and server hardware, I even have my own
            server and NAS at home which I always tinker with. I also enjoy using Linux and learning my way through its
            terminal, which this job calls for as it requires Linux experience. I will also get to help consumers with
            issues and deliver business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The position of Senior Linux Systems Administrator entails a multitude of responsibilities, I will have to
            manage enterprise Linux distributions (such as RedHat Linux) and servers, and continuously troubleshoot and
            fix issues that arise with them. I will have to deal with any escalated issues which lower levels or IT
            support can not deal with, talk with shareholders about key IT decisions for the business, and additionally
            design future software and hardware configurations that the business may need.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the job position of Senior Linux Systems Administrator falls under the larger umbrella of IT jobs, it
            will require me to constantly learn and refine my skills as year after year, the standards within the
            industry drastically change and deployments quickly become outdated and incompatible if not maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
            The IT industry focuses heavily on experience over qualifications and thus any undergraduate degree within
            the IT umbrella is acceptable (Information Technology, Computer Science, Software Development). A large
            amount of experience is required to obtain this job position, a candidate needs in-depth knowledge of Linux
            systems and must know how to deploy, maintain and troubleshoot them. A candidate must also have Level 3 IT
            Help Desk experience within a large company and should be able to automate as many processes as possible
            using tools such as “Puppet” and “Ansible”.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently enrolled in a Bachelor of Information Technology and hope to learn key skills for future
            jobs, I have moderate experience with Linux Systems as my servers run Linux and I have limited experience
            with the automation service "Ansible". I believe that I have great problem-solving skills and determination
            that will entice any possible employer.
        </p>
        <p>
            I plan to obtain all the skills and qualifications required in a multitude of methods. Firstly I plan to
            finish my studies at RMIT to obtain a Bachelor of Information Technology and then I plan to do micro-courses
            online to gain industry-specific knowledge. I plan to start my IT career as an IT Helpdesk Intern, progress
            to an IT Helpdesk Technician, Junior Systems Administrator, Systems administrator and ultimately a Senior
            Systems Administrator. While this may seem straightforward, it is not and may take 15+ years to reach.

            <p>
                The results of this test indicate that my personality type is Turbulent Virtuoso (ISTP-T) and that I am
                Introverted, Observant, Thinking, Prospecting and Turbulent. The test suggests that my strengths are
                being optimistic, creative and rational (https://www.16personalities.com/istp-strengths-and-weaknesses)
                while my weaknesses are that I can be stubborn, reserved and easily bored. The test also suggests that I
                am an explorer and always am looking for new ideas and I am constantly trying to improve myself.

            </p>
            <p>
                The results can influence my behaviour in a team as I will be able to provide rational ideas to the
                group and won’t hesitate to be blunt, I will be able to prioritise and plan effectively while happily
                engaging in practical work. But I may be insensitive towards group members and stubborn on an idea
                choice, which can lead to fighting within the group. This can harm productivity, but the strengths may
                possibly outweigh the weaknesses.

            </p>
            <p>
                I should take my results into account as I will be able to apply them in the right areas. I should
                volunteer to practical work in my group and additionally refrain from giving out too many blunt
                responses. I should be in a group with a leader that knows how to effectively manage a group and harness
                its strengths and weaknesses.

            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that this test accurately depicts some of my traits while missing others, for example, I
                believe that I make a good team leader and am able to manage a group effectively, taking into account
                everyone's thoughts and opinions. But this test suggests that I may be stubborn and insensitive in a
                group setting.

            <p>
                The results of this test indicate that I best learn using a kinesthetic style, where I can learn new
                information through the process of physical activity. The results also indicate that I learn least
                effectively through auditory styles, such as lectures and group discussions. This suggests that I would
                learn by participating more than just watching, and I would additionally enjoy physical experiments.
                However, I would make a very bad listener and will not be able to process large amounts of verbal or
                written information effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                These results can affect my behaviour in a team as I would likely enjoy the physical experiments but now
                be fully active in verbal group discussions. However as the test suggests I am still an average visual
                learner, I will be able to process physical and visual information better in a group.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will have to take this into account when forming a team and forming one with people who are able to
                learn auditorily as there may be information presented to use that certain members of the group will be
                able to grasp easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not fully agree with this test's predictions, it suggests that as a kinesthetic style learner, I
                should enjoy athletics and physical education, however, I dislike athletics and do not have any sporting
                hobbies.

                A divergent association test measures how creative a person is by requiring them to list words that are
                semantically distant from each other. The results for this test suggest that I am slightly above average
                for creativity as my words were more semantically distant compared to the average. This suggests that I
                am creative and am able to think of new ideas and solutions effectively. This may be useful for a future
                employer as I may encounter problems that need creative solutions.

            </p>
            <p>
                This will help me in a group as I will be able to suggest unique ideas to progress the group throughout
                tasks. I will also be able to write engaging text pieces which may be necessary for the project to
                thrive.

                As a result of this test, I will not have to change anything in regards to my group selection methods,
                as I will be able to share ideas no matter the group.

        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I plan to create a website and phone application which together allow an individual to print out QR
            Codes or
            write NFC tags that can facilitate a scavenger hunt. The objectives will be called “beacons” and the
            game
            “host” can create a certain amount of them which the program will then convert into either QR Codes or
            allow
            the host to write onto NFC tags. These “beacons” can then be placed in random locations in a certain
            area
            (can be as small as a room or even cover entire countries!) and the players will have to scan the QR
            Code or
            NFC tag using the corresponding mobile application, which keeps track of remaining beacons in the game
            and
            can give out hints to the player. The host can set up the game in multiple modes such as assigning
            players
            to teams or only allowing the beacons to be acquired in a certain order. The host will be able to see
            all
            the progress on their device and will be notified of the winner.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            As a child, I remember playing scavenger hunt with stamps tied to trees and a sheet where we had to
            collect
            them. These were fun but were only possible because we were in a closed environment (school) and there
            weren't a large number of groups playing at any given time. I want to expand that concept and allow
            anyone
            with a smartphone to easily set up a game and play with as many people as they want over as large of an
            area
            they desire. Current scavenger hunts take a long time to set up and require a high amount of
            administrative
            work to track winners and locations of objectives, I want to remove all that admin work and let a
            computer
            deal with it.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            <u>How it works:</u><br>
            The service will feature an admin page for the host and a hunting page for the players.
            The main playstyle is based on the classic scavenger hunt and the objectives are called “beacons”.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Hosting:</u><br>
            On the website, the host will create a game that will have a unique code and will select the number of
            beacons they want. Here they will be able to individually name each beacon, enter its geographic
            location
            (optional), add a clue on how to find the beacon (optional) and enter a message they want to be
            displayed
            when a player captures the beacon (optional). After adding all beacons, the host can set the game mode
            and
            can then pick if the game will be played with QR Codes or via NFC. If the host selects QR Code, a pdf
            will
            be generated containing a QR Code for each location which whey can place there. If NFC is selected, the
            host
            will be prompted to switch to the phone app on an NFC capable phone, where they will be prompted to
            present
            an NFC card to write to for each beacon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Game Modes:</u><br>
            The game can be played as a private group or open to the public, when private group beacons are scanned,
            they will require the user to be authenticated before the app accepts them.<br><br>
            The host can pick if the beacons can be captured in any order or a specific order.<br><br>
            If the host supplied a geographical location for a beacon when creating the lobby they can enable
            location verification on the players' devices.<br><br>
            verification, where the player's device location will have to be within a certain radius of the beacon
            location when it is scanned to deter cheating.<br><br>
            Individual: First player to capture all beacons will win.<br><br>
            Team: First team to capture all beacons will win.<br><br>
            Rush: Once a player/team captures a beacon no one else can scan it, once all beacons are captured the
            player/team with the majority of beacons will win.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Playing:</u><br>
            The player will need to log in on either the mobile app or mobile-friendly website. When they scan a QR
            Code
            or NFC tag it will be read by the app/website and if the user is logged in and has access to the
            particular
            games lobby, it will be added to their inventory. They will be able to see a list of all the beacons in
            the
            game and view hints on how to access them, if it is a team game relevant statistics will also be
            displayed.
            If the host has enabled location verification the app/website will request the user's location to verify
            that they are physically near the beacon location.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Security:</u><br>
            If this project is released to the public, there may be personal data that has to be handled
            appropriately
            and additionally security risks with the use of QR Codes and NFC Tags. The service may collect the
            player's
            location if the host requires it and that information should only be stored for verification and not
            stored
            on the server as that would add unnecessary security risks to the service. The use of QR Codes and NFC
            Tags
            also has inherent security risks, as a user may scan a malicious QR Code or tap a malicious NFC Tag
            designed
            to look like a beacon code/tag. Currently, there are no known exploits that allow code execution on
            devices
            that scan QR Codes or NFC Tags, but there have been in the past and thus can exist in the future, this
            risk
            will always exist and there is no easy solution other than temporally disabling the service if an
            exploit
            like such is revealed.

        <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
        <p>
            For the development and deployment of the service, some key tools and technologies will be required. A
            server will be required that can run the backend programs, host databases and relay real-time lobby
            information between players and hosts.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the key technologies that will be used are:
        <ul>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>NodeJS</li>
            <li>Apache Cordova</li>
            <li>Progressive Web Apps</li>
            <li>QR Codes</li>
            <li>NFC Tags</li>
            <li>NFC Readers/Writers</li>
            <li>Android/IOS Apps</li>
            <li>SQL Databases</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Skills Required</h2>
        <p>
            A variety of skills are required to make this project functional, there needs to be proficiency in the
            programming languages that will likely be used, such as Javascript and PHP. Additionally, knowledge in
            SQL
            Databases is required as significant amounts of relational data may need to be processed. Some UI/UX
            designing experience is also ideal as a large number of visual interfaces need to be constructed.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
            If this project is successful it will easily allow primary/secondary schools and event organisers to set
            up
            a scavenger hunt game. It will save them large amounts of time as they need to do very little physical
            work
            to set it up and for public games, the general public will get to enjoy mysterious QR Codes (although if
            you
            scan a random QR Code that's concerning) that lead them around places. If governments set up a game that
            covers a city it can cause great engagement within the city, especially with tourists.
